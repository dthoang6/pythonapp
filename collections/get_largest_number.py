# This program demonstrate different between mutable and immutable
# Mutable object: list, set, dic, other data type from third party library
# Immutable data type: str, int, bool, float, bytes, tuple

# List [] ordered, mutable, duplicates ok
# Tuple () ordered, immutable, duplicates ok, fast
# Dict {pair: value,...} unorderd, mutable, no duplicate
# Set myset ={"apple", "banana", "cherry"} unordered, unchangeable but can remove item and add new item, unindexed
